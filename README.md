# line-linker

## Features

Quickly create app links to a specific line in VSCode, in the form: `vscode://file/<path_to_editor_file>:<selected_line_number>`. You can then click that link to open the file in VSCode at that line number, from anywhere.

## How to use

Simply right click on a line in any VSCode editor window, then select `Copy link to line`. This will copy the app link to your clipboard.

## Requirements

- Works on MacOS and probably Linux. I haven't tested it on Windows, so best of luck to you.
- Make sure your VSCode is up to date otherwise it might not work with app links.
